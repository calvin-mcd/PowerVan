# PowerVan

The PowerVan is a minivan style pcb with LAE support, forced HHKB, and a bottom row that is inspired by vintage typewriters.

Concept is by swear_wolf. The pcb is based on matthewdias' [m3n3van](https://github.com/matthewdias/m3n3van).

## Case

swear_wolf is designing a dedicated case for this. The pcb itself supports standard minivan traymount holes as well as an additional daughterbord for more case compatibility. The HHKB is forced however.
  
## Disclaimer

V1 has a revised JST position, to avoid interference with traymount cases. This version has not been tested yet, but changes are minor.

This PCB has been fully tested and is confirmed to work. However, no-one involved in this project is responsible for any usage issues that may arise. Order at your own risk. Feel free to edit, modify and otherwise utilise these files.
