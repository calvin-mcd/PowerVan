# PowerVan

The PowerVan is a minivan style pcb with LAE support, forced HHKB, and a bottom row that is inspired by vintage typewriters.

Concept is by swear_wolf. The pcb is based on matthewdias' [m3n3van](https://github.com/matthewdias/m3n3van).

## Case

swear_wolf is designing a dedicated case for this. The pcb itself supports standard minivan traymount holes as well as an additional daughterbord for more case compatibility. The HHKB is forced however.
